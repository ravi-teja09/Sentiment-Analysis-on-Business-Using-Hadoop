"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders The minimum wage is immaterial. What matters is an annual cost of living adjustment - as is done for Social Security recipients. Single payer healthcare would lower costs and save money. College is an investment that would pay much better returns than Ponzi scheme markets."
"@GreekFire23 When are you going to earn your paycheck Greek...instead of feeding off markets you know, even better than me, are rigged?"
"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders Any economic system can exist in our imaginations but there has never been an economy without government involvement and there never will be. Truly free markets aren't sustainable anyway. Have you ever played the board game 'Monopoly'? It always ends with one and only one winner."
"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders And in my opinion earned income is far for valuable than a system of rigged markets and uninformed 'investors'."
"@HankWinslow @GreekFire23 I definitely EARNED this profit through hard work, ingenuity and risk taking. There is absolutely no comparison between earning profit this way and people putting money in rigged markets...most with little to no understanding of what they are even pretending to 'invest' in."
"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders I used the game 'Monopoly' only to illustrate an artificial scenario of completely free markets. I believe this game strongly suggests that any such game, if played long enough, would result in virtually the same outcome."
"@HankWinslow @GreekFire23 Except since the 2008 crash the only risk was that the government and Fed would change their mind and stop propping up the markets with massive debt and monetary manipulation. Given this *purposeful* manipulation the risk argument is completely disingenuous and you know it."
"@HankWinslow @GreekFire23 I was in the stock market up until 2005 when I was forced to acknowledge how corrupt it is. I took out all my money and vowed never to return. It only became much more corrupt after the 2008 crash. There has been virtually no 'investing' in these markets since then."
"@GreekFire23 A lot of people apparently understand how it works but I've seen no one willing to do anything to address the inevitable catastrophe this massive increase in fiscal debt, monetary manipulation and Ponzi scheme markets will lead to."
"@HankWinslow @GreekFire23 So far it has been compounding much more beautifully for the 52 percent of Americans who have money in the markets which the massive increase in fiscal debt and monetary manipulation are designed to benefit. The gains are being privatized and the debt is being socialized."
"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders You are in the stock market but don't know what an index fund is??? How is that possible? These Ponzi scheme markets have been pumped up with government money. This is massive theft and you are apparently oblivious to it."
"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders 48 percent of Americans have no money in the stock market. Of those who do, the vast majority of the returns go to the top 1 and 10 percent. These markets have been purposefully rigged to benefit only half the country. https://t.co/8Svj3Y76IB"
"@HankWinslow @GreekFire23 I spoke of ONE theft related to Ponzi scheme markets that have been purposefully propped up with PUBLIC debt &amp; central bank monetary manipulation and your answer is to divert attention to other subjects. I repeat...the gains are being privatized and the debt is being socialized."
"@michael_yuknis @BernieSanders Hypocrites love to talk about 'earning their way' but somehow are fine with taking part in the largest, most corrupt transfer of wealth in the history of capitalism since the 2008 crash as the gains of Ponzi scheme markets have been privatized while the debt has been socialized."
